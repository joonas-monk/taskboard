# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** One place to capture ideas and track them through to completion — from idea to done, visually and with drag & drop.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Board Shell (complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Board Shell)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase 2 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Phase 2 Plan 1 executed: board shell UI complete

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 0.25 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Data Foundation | 1/1 | 10 min | 10 min |
| 2. Board Shell | 1/1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 10min, 5min
- Trend: improving

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use Prisma 7 (not Drizzle) — stronger DX, schema-first, Prisma Studio; architecture patterns are identical for either ORM
- [Init]: Store SQLite database at absolute path outside project dir (`/var/data/taskboard/tasks.db`) — prevents data loss on redeploy
- [Init]: Use Next.js standalone output mode (not static export) — static export silently breaks Server Actions
- [01-01]: DATABASE_URL uses user-local path for development; production path /var/data/taskboard/ set during Phase 5 deployment
- [01-01]: Prisma 7 seed command configured in prisma.config.ts (not package.json) per Prisma 7 API
- [01-01]: Zod 4 used for validation (installed version); API compatible with plan's Zod 3 patterns
- [01-01]: Next.js 16 project scaffolded as prerequisite (greenfield project had no existing app)
- [Phase 02-01]: BoardLoader client wrapper: Next.js 16 disallows ssr:false in Server Components, dynamic import moved to thin client component
- [Phase 02-01]: Serialized types in src/types/index.ts (not page.tsx) to prevent client components importing from Server Component files

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: ORM inconsistency resolved — committed to Prisma 7 with working schema and migration.
- [Phase 4]: Float ordering edge cases now specified — initial spacing 1000, rebalance threshold 0.001, position utilities implemented.
